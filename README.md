## Usage

### Development

Just run and visit http://localhost:3333

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
pnpm build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.

### Deploy on Netlify

Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and select your clone, `OK` along the way, and your App will be live in a minute.

### Docker Production Build

First, build the vitesse image by opening the terminal in the project's root directory.

```bash
docker buildx build . -t vitesse:latest
```

Run the image and specify port mapping with the `-p` flag.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vitesse:latest
```

## Why

I have created several Vite apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. It's strongly opinionated, but feel free to tweak it or even maintain your own forks. [(see community maintained variation forks)](#variations)
